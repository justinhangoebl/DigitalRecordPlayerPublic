# The Debug version of the Digital Record Player

This is a Dummy Server to make some stuff work on a Desktop Environment, to not only use the RaspberryPI, so everybody can test a small base version. And it cannot be the same, because the RaspberryPi has another IP - Address in the Network and the ClientSecret and ClientID is different.


## Installing the neccessary packages

```
npm install
```

### Running the Server

```
npm run dev
```

There will be 4 warnings but those are package intern warnings which cannot be fixed by our end.
